# Yr-12-project
A clone of the first level of Mario in blitz basic 2d. I've lost the finished version -- this is actually what prompted me to put all my really old stuff up on GitHub. At least I still have the partially completed one.


Includes a version of blitz basic 2d demo because it's really obscure and hard to find. The exe has been lost to the ages, I'm afraid.
